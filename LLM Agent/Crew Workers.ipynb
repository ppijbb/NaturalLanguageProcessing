with past history of COVID-19 in northeastern Nigeria.\n","Copyright Information: © 2024. The Author(s).\n","Summary::\n","BACKGROUND: An increased risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) after COVID-19 has been reported in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The burden of COVID-related DM has yet to be described in Africa, where the overall risk of DM has been increasing rapidly. Our objective was to compare the prevalence of pre-DM and DM in Nigerian individuals with a history of COVID-19 to individuals without known COVID-19 infection.\n","METHODS: We undertook a retrospective cohort study with 256 individuals with a past medical history of COVID-19 with no history of pre-DM or DM and 256 individuals without a history of COVID-19 or pre-DM/DM. Participants were categorized as pre-DM (fasting capillary glucose 100-125 mg/dL) or DM (fasting capillary glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL). We employed univariate and multivariable logistic regression to identify key predictors and adjust for confounders related to hyperglycaemia risk factors. Additionally, we used multinomial logistic regression to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 history and diabetes status, distinguishing between normal, pre-diabetic, and diabetic glucose levels. All models were adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, physical activity, central adiposity, and family history of DM.\n","RESULTS: Compared to the control group, those with a history of COVID-19 had a similar median age (38 vs. 40 years, p = 0.84), had a higher proportion of men (63% vs. 49%), and had a lower prevalence of central adiposity (waist: hip ratio ≥ 0.90 for males and WHR ≥ 0.85 for females) (48% vs. 56.3%, p = 0.06). Of the 256 with a history of COVID-19, 44 (17%) required in-patient care. The median (interquartile range) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and the glycaemic assessment was 19 (IQR: 14, 24) months. Pre-DM prevalence was 27% in the post-COVID-19 group and 4% in\n","\u001b[00m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mthe control group (p < 0.001). DM prevalence was 10% in the post-COVID-19 group and 2% in the control group (p < 0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression model, a history of COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of pre-DM (odds ratio [OR] = 8.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2-15.6, p < 0.001) and DM (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.1-14.0, p < 0.001). In the multinomial logistic regression model, a history of COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of pre-DM (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 7.3, 95% CI = 3.7-14.4, p < 0.001) and DM (RRR = 5.3, 95% CI = 2.2-12.9, p < 0.001) compared to normal glucose levels.\n","CONCLUSION: In this cohort of Nigerian individuals, a history of COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of pre-DM and DM, independent of traditional risk factors. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 may contribute to the increasing burden of DM in Africa. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms and optimal screening strategies for post-COVID-19 hyperglycaemia.\n","\n","Thought:\n","I need to find out more specific symptoms of diabetes.\n","\n","Action:\n","pub_med\n","\n","Action Input:\n","{\"query\": \"specific symptoms of diabetes\"}\n","\n","Observation\u001b[0mToo Many Requests, waiting for 0.40 seconds...\n","\u001b[95m \n","\n","Published: 2024-09-12\n","Title: A national survey of current rehabilitation service provisions for people living with chronic kidney disease in the UK: implications for policy and practice.\n","Copyright Information: © 2024.
