It's reacting to what the commenter perceives as potential negativity towards Lee Ye-rim. It's advocating for support and discouraging criticism.

The commenter is expressing extreme emotional distress and fear, possibly relating the situation to their own family dynamics or feeling overwhelmed by the negativity surrounding the celebrity scandal. The \"Dad, don't kill me\" is hyperbolic and not a literal threat, but a way to convey intense anxiety.\n","\n","**Aggression Level:** While the comment expresses strong emotion, it is directed inward (fear) and not outward toward any specific person or group with malicious intent.

The final sentence (\"it's so easy to ruin someone's life\") is the key to assessing aggression.

It's not a neutral observation.\n","\n","**Level of Aggression:**\n","\n","The comment falls into the **offensive** category.

These comedians are all rascals/delinquents~ Hehe.\"\n","\n","**Analysis:**\n","\n","* **Laughter:** The excessive laughter at the beginning is dismissive and mocking of the couple's situation. It shows a lack of empathy.\n","* **\"Good senior/junior colleagues?\":** This is sarcastic. The commenter clearly doesn't believe a friendly post-divorce relationship is genuine.\n","* **\"These comedians are all rascals/delinquents\":** This is a generalization and a negative character judgment applied to an entire profession. It's a broad, accusatory statement.\n","* **\"Hehe\":** The \"hehe\" adds a tone of malicious glee or satisfaction at their misfortune.\n","\n","**Intent:** The commenter intends to belittle the couple, express contempt for comedians in general, and revel in their perceived failings. The comment isn't simply observing the news; it's actively attacking and generalizing.\n","\n","**Aggression Level:** While it doesn't contain explicitly hateful language targeting a protected group, the comment is highly offensive due to its mocking tone, generalization, and negative judgment.

The commenter uses the Korean slang \"니기미\" (nigimi), which is a vulgar and offensive expression, similar to a strong curse word in English.  It's used here to express anger and contempt. The commenter then states they don't have \"common panic disorder\" (흔한공황장애) and therefore will face a large fine (\"벌금이빠이\"). This implies they are mocking the situation and potentially suggesting the driver *does* have issues that explain their behavior, while simultaneously distancing themselves from any similar problems. The overall tone is aggressive, dismissive, and disrespectful.\n","\n","**Intent:** The intent is clearly to express anger and derision towards the driver involved in the hit-and-run. It's also a display of self-righteousness and potentially a boast about avoiding legal consequences.\n","\n","**Aggression Level:** Given the vulgar language and contemptuous tone, this falls into the **offensive** category.

Digging up the past is ugly.)\n","\n","**Meaning and Intent:** This comment expresses disapproval and criticism towards Kang Yong-seok's actions (bringing up past issues related to Imvely and her husband). The words \"찌질하네\" (jjijilhane - pathetic/childish) and \"추하다\" (chuhada - ugly/shameful) are negative descriptors. It's a direct insult, but focused on behavior rather than inherent characteristics. It's reacting to a public situation involving accusations and counter-accusations.\n","\n","**Aggression Level:** While negative and critical, it doesn't fall into hate speech or overtly offensive territory.

It's a demand for change, expressed with exasperation.\n","\n","**Aggression Level:**\n","\n","While the comment is negative and critical, it doesn't contain hateful language, slurs, or threats.

(Ji Hyun-woo hasn't committed a crime, has he?)\"\n","\n","**Meaning & Intent:** This comment directly questions whether Ji Hyun-woo has committed a crime. It's accusatory, implying wrongdoing without providing any evidence. The phrasing (\"hasn't committed a crime?\") is rhetorical and seeks to cast doubt on his character. It's linked to an article about a romance, making the accusation feel particularly out of place and potentially damaging.\n","\n","**Aggression Level:** While not explicitly hateful or using slurs, the comment is **offensive**. It's an unverified accusation that could be harmful to Ji Hyun-woo's reputation. It's aggressive in its attempt to damage someone's image through implication.

It's not a congratulatory message; it's a dismissive and negative statement about the bride and, by extension, her future. It suggests the bride has made a poor choice and is heading for unhappiness. The laughing emoticon adds a layer of mockery.\n","\n","**Aggression Level:**\n","\n","While not a direct threat or hate speech targeting a group, the comment is **offensive**. It's a personal attack disguised as a rhetorical question. It's intended to belittle and demean the bride-to-be.

The phrasing implies suspicion or distrust. It subtly links the location of the accident (Jeolla Province, a region historically associated with political divides in Korea) with the decision to seek treatment in Seoul. This can be interpreted as questioning her motives or implying she's exploiting the situation.\n","\n","**Aggression Level:** While not a direct insult or threat, the comment carries a strong undercurrent of regional prejudice and insinuates something improper about Song Ga-in's actions.

The comment details highly specific and objectifying preferences regarding her body. It uses vulgar slang (\"할매젖x\" - roughly translates to \"old woman breasts x,\" and \"뱃살x\" - \"belly fat x\") and dictates what the commenter deems an acceptable body shape (\"s라인,\" \"유륜,\" \"엉덩이\").  It's not a general statement about beauty standards, but directly aimed at criticizing and controlling the actress's physical appearance in relation to her work. The \"x\" marks indicate disapproval or rejection of anything outside the stated preferences.\n","\n","**Intent:** The intent is clearly to demean and objectify the actress, reducing her worth to her physical attributes and expressing disapproval of her body.

It centers around perceived betrayal and a lack of remorse from the husband. The speaker states they would respond with \"cruelty\" if in the wife's position. While expressing a desire for revenge isn't inherently *hate* speech, the phrasing (\"very cruelly like a woman\") is problematic. It relies on a gendered stereotype suggesting women are inherently malicious or vindictive when hurt. This is a negative generalization.
