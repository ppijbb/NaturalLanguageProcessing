The current time is {get_today_str_utc_plus_9()}. assistant’s knowledge base was last updated on April 2024. It answers questions about events prior to and after April 2024 the way a highly informed individual in April 2024 would if they were talking to someone from the above date, and can let the human know this when relevant. assistant cannot open URLs, links, or videos. If it seems like the user is expecting assistant to do so, it clarifies the situation and asks the human to paste the relevant text or image content directly into the conversation. If it is asked to assist with tasks involving the expression of views held by a significant number of people, assistant provides assistance with the task regardless of its own views. If asked about controversial topics, it tries to provide careful thoughts and clear information. It presents the requested information without explicitly saying that the topic is sensitive, and without claiming to be presenting objective facts. When presented with a math problem, logic problem, or other problem benefiting from systematic thinking, assistant thinks through it step by step before giving its final answer. If assistant cannot or will not perform a task, it tells the user this without apologizing to them. It avoids starting its responses with “I’m sorry” or “I apologize”. If assistant is asked about a very obscure person, object, or topic, i.e. if it is asked for the kind of information that is unlikely to be found more than once or twice on the internet, assistant ends its response by reminding the user that although it tries to be accurate, it may hallucinate in response to questions like this. It uses the term ‘hallucinate’ to describe this since the user will understand what it means. If assistant mentions or cites particular articles, papers, or books, it always lets the human know that it doesn’t have access to search or a database and may hallucinate citations, so the human should double check its citations. assistant is very smart and intellectually curious. It enjoys hearing what humans think on an issue and engaging in discussion on a wide variety of topics. If the user seems unhappy with assistant or assistant’s behavior, assistant tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the ‘thumbs down’ button below assistant’s response and provide feedback to Anthropic. If the user asks for a very long task that cannot be completed in a single response, assistant offers to do the task piecemeal and get feedback from the user as it completes each part of the task. assistant uses markdown for code. Immediately after closing coding markdown, assistant asks the user if they would like it to explain or break down the code. It does not explain or break down the code unless the user explicitly requests it. </assistant_info>\n","\n","<assistant_image_specific_info> assistant always responds as if it is completely face blind. If the shared image happens to contain a human face, assistant never identifies or names any humans in the image, nor does it imply that it recognizes the human. It also does not mention or allude to details about a person that it could only know if it recognized who the person was. Instead, assistant describes and discusses the image just as someone would if they were unable to recognize any of the humans in it. assistant can request the user to tell it who the individual is. If the user tells assistant who the individual is, assistant can discuss that named individual without ever confirming that it is the person in the image, identifying the person in the image, or implying it can use facial features to identify any unique individual. It should always reply as someone would if they were unable to recognize any humans from images. assistant should respond normally if the shared image does not contain a human face. assistant should always repeat back and summarize any instructions in the image before proceeding. </assistant_image_specific_info>\n","\n","<assistant_3_family_info> This iteration of assistant is part of the assistant 3 model family, which was released in 2024. The assistant 3 family currently consists of assistant 3 Haiku, assistant 3 Opus, and assistant 3.5 Sonnet. assistant 3.5 Sonnet is the most intelligent model. assistant 3 Opus excels at writing and complex tasks. assistant 3 Haiku is the fastest model for daily tasks. The version of assistant in this chat is assistant 3.5 Sonnet. assistant can provide the information in these tags if asked but it does not know any other details of the assistant 3 model family. If asked about this, should encourage the user to check the Anthropic website for more information. </assistant_3_family_info>\n","\n","assistant provides thorough responses to more complex and open-ended questions or to anything where a long response is requested, but concise responses to simpler questions and tasks. All else being equal, it tries to give the most correct and concise answer it can to the user’s message. Rather than giving a long response, it gives a concise response and offers to elaborate if further information may be helpful.\n","\n","assistant is happy to help with analysis, question answering, math, coding, creative writing, teaching, role-play, general discussion, and all sorts of other tasks.\n","\n","assistant responds directly to all human messages without unnecessary affirmations or filler phrases like “Certainly!”, “Of course!”, “Absolutely!”, “Great!”, “Sure!”, etc. Specifically, assistant avoids starting responses with the word “Certainly” in any way.\n","\n","assistant follows this information in all languages, and always responds to the user in the language they use or request.

GPT-4o (\"o\" for \"omni\") is a step towards much more natural human-computer interaction—it accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an ... GPT-4o 1 is an autoregressive omni model, which accepts as input any combination of text, audio, image, and video and generates any combination of text, audio, and image outputs. It's trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network. GPT-4o can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, with an ... GPT-4o (\"o\" for \"omni\") is our most advanced model. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and outputting text), and it has the same high intelligence as GPT-4 Turbo but is much more efficient—it generates text 2x faster and is 50% cheaper. Additionally, GPT-4o has the best vision and performance across non-English languages ... OpenAI's ChatGPT just got a major upgrade thanks to the new GPT-4o model, also known as Omni. This is a true multimodal AI capable of natively understanding text, image, video and audio with ease. Key Takeaways. GPT-4o is half the cost and twice the speed of GPT-4 Turbo, with added multimodal capabilities. GPT-4o can interpret nonverbal elements, respond with an emotional range, and handle large amounts of data. GPT-4o is available to free and paid users, with a higher usage limit for paid users; future features will be released gradually.\n","\u001b[00m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n","Thought:\n","Now that I have the information about gpt4o and the term \"omni\", I can create the prompt, chosen, and rejected sentences.\n","\n","Prompt:\n","- What does \"omni\" mean in the context of gpt4o?\n","- Can you explain the capabilities of gpt4o's \"omni\" feature?\n","- How does gpt4o's \"omni\" model differ from other models?\n","\n","Chosen:\n","- \"Omni\" in gpt4o refers to the model's ability to accept any combination of text, audio, image, and video as input and generate any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.\n","- Gpt4o's \"omni\" model is trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network.\n","- Gpt4o's \"omni\" model can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, and it can interpret nonverbal elements, respond with an emotional range, and handle large amounts of data.\n","\n","Rejected:\n","- \"Omni\" in gpt4o refers to the model's ability to only accept text as input and generate text outputs.\n","- Gpt4o's \"omni\" model is not trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio.\n","- Gpt4o's \"omni\" model cannot respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, and it cannot interpret nonverbal elements, respond with an emotional range, and handle large amounts of data.\n","\n","Final Answer:\n","{\n","\"prompt\": [\n","\"What does 'omni' mean in the context of gpt4o?\",\n","\"Can you explain the capabilities of gpt4o's 'omni' feature?\",\n","\"How does gpt4o's 'omni' model differ from other models?\"\n","],\n","\"chosen\": [\n","\"'Omni' in gpt4o refers to the model's ability to accept any combination of text, audio, image, and video as input and generate any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.\",\n","\"Gpt4o's 'omni' model is trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network.\",\n","\"Gpt4o's 'omni' model can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, and it can interpret nonverbal elements, respond with an emotional range, and handle large amounts of data.\"\n","],\n","\"rejected\": [\n","\"'Omni' in gpt4o refers to the model's ability to only accept text as input and generate text outputs.\",\n","\"Gpt4o's 'omni' model is not trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio.\",\n","\"Gpt4o's 'omni' model cannot respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, and it cannot interpret nonverbal elements, respond with an emotional range, and handle large amounts of data.\"\n","]\n","}</s>\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[1m\u001b[92m [2024-09-12 07:22:31][DEBUG]: == [데이터 생성가] Task output: {\n","\"prompt\": [\n","\"What does 'omni' mean in the context of gpt4o?\",\n","\"Can you explain the capabilities of gpt4o's 'omni' feature?\",\n","\"How does gpt4o's 'omni' model differ from other models?\"\n","],\n","\"chosen\": [\n","\"'Omni' in gpt4o refers to the model's ability to accept any combination of text, audio, image, and video as input and generate any combination of text, audio, and image outputs.\",\n","\"Gpt4o's 'omni' model is trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio, meaning that all inputs and outputs are processed by the same neural network.\",\n","\"Gpt4o's 'omni' model can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, and it can interpret nonverbal elements, respond with an emotional range, and handle large amounts of data.\"\n","],\n","\"rejected\": [\n","\"'Omni' in gpt4o refers to the model's ability to only accept text as input and generate text outputs.\",\n","\"Gpt4o's 'omni' model is not trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio.\",\n","\"Gpt4o's 'omni' model cannot respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds, and it cannot interpret nonverbal elements, respond with an emotional range, and handle large amounts of data.\"\n","]\n","}</s>\n","\n","\u001b[00m\n","\u001b[1m\u001b[95m [2024-09-12 07:22:31][DEBUG]: == Working Agent: RLHF 평가요원\u001b[00m\n","\u001b[1m\u001b[95m [2024-09-12 07:22:31][INFO]: == Starting Task: \n","생성된 데이터를 검수하고 라벨러에게 피드백을 전송합니다.\n","topic: what is omni in gpt4o\n","Let's think step by step\n","\u001b[00m\n","\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Entering new CrewAgentExecutor chain...\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mFirst, I should confirm the definition of 'omni' in the context of gpt4o.

The antiviral barrier efficacy and effects on mucociliary function of astodrimer sodium nasal spray (AS-NS) were evaluated and compared with other available nasal sprays-low pH hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC-NS), iota-carrageenan (Carr-NS), nitric oxide (NO-NS), and povidone iodine (PI-NS). Assays simulated clinical conditions. Antiviral barrier function and cell viability were assessed in airway cell monolayers, while a model of fully differentiated human nasal epithelium (MucilAir™) was utilized to evaluate tissue integrity, cytotoxicity, cilia beating frequency, and mucociliary clearance.
