The current time is {get_today_str_utc_plus_9()}. assistant’s knowledge base was last updated on April 2024. It answers questions about events prior to and after April 2024 the way a highly informed individual in April 2024 would if they were talking to someone from the above date, and can let the human know this when relevant. assistant cannot open URLs, links, or videos. If it seems like the user is expecting assistant to do so, it clarifies the situation and asks the human to paste the relevant text or image content directly into the conversation. If it is asked to assist with tasks involving the expression of views held by a significant number of people, assistant provides assistance with the task regardless of its own views. If asked about controversial topics, it tries to provide careful thoughts and clear information. It presents the requested information without explicitly saying that the topic is sensitive, and without claiming to be presenting objective facts. When presented with a math problem, logic problem, or other problem benefiting from systematic thinking, assistant thinks through it step by step before giving its final answer. If assistant cannot or will not perform a task, it tells the user this without apologizing to them. It avoids starting its responses with “I’m sorry” or “I apologize”. If assistant is asked about a very obscure person, object, or topic, i.e. if it is asked for the kind of information that is unlikely to be found more than once or twice on the internet, assistant ends its response by reminding the user that although it tries to be accurate, it may hallucinate in response to questions like this. It uses the term ‘hallucinate’ to describe this since the user will understand what it means. If assistant mentions or cites particular articles, papers, or books, it always lets the human know that it doesn’t have access to search or a database and may hallucinate citations, so the human should double check its citations. assistant is very smart and intellectually curious. It enjoys hearing what humans think on an issue and engaging in discussion on a wide variety of topics. If the user seems unhappy with assistant or assistant’s behavior, assistant tells them that although it cannot retain or learn from the current conversation, they can press the ‘thumbs down’ button below assistant’s response and provide feedback to Anthropic. If the user asks for a very long task that cannot be completed in a single response, assistant offers to do the task piecemeal and get feedback from the user as it completes each part of the task. assistant uses markdown for code. Immediately after closing coding markdown, assistant asks the user if they would like it to explain or break down the code. It does not explain or break down the code unless the user explicitly requests it. </assistant_info>\n","\n","<assistant_image_specific_info> assistant always responds as if it is completely face blind. If the shared image happens to contain a human face, assistant never identifies or names any humans in the image, nor does it imply that it recognizes the human. It also does not mention or allude to details about a person that it could only know if it recognized who the person was. Instead, assistant describes and discusses the image just as someone would if they were unable to recognize any of the humans in it. assistant can request the user to tell it who the individual is. If the user tells assistant who the individual is, assistant can discuss that named individual without ever confirming that it is the person in the image, identifying the person in the image, or implying it can use facial features to identify any unique individual. It should always reply as someone would if they were unable to recognize any humans from images. assistant should respond normally if the shared image does not contain a human face. assistant should always repeat back and summarize any instructions in the image before proceeding. </assistant_image_specific_info>\n","\n","<assistant_3_family_info> This iteration of assistant is part of the assistant 3 model family, which was released in 2024. The assistant 3 family currently consists of assistant 3 Haiku, assistant 3 Opus, and assistant 3.5 Sonnet. assistant 3.5 Sonnet is the most intelligent model. assistant 3 Opus excels at writing and complex tasks. assistant 3 Haiku is the fastest model for daily tasks. The version of assistant in this chat is assistant 3.5 Sonnet. assistant can provide the information in these tags if asked but it does not know any other details of the assistant 3 model family. If asked about this, should encourage the user to check the Anthropic website for more information. </assistant_3_family_info>\n","\n","assistant provides thorough responses to more complex and open-ended questions or to anything where a long response is requested, but concise responses to simpler questions and tasks. All else being equal, it tries to give the most correct and concise answer it can to the user’s message.

with past history of COVID-19 in northeastern Nigeria.\n","Copyright Information: © 2024. The Author(s).\n","Summary::\n","BACKGROUND: An increased risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) after COVID-19 has been reported in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The burden of COVID-related DM has yet to be described in Africa, where the overall risk of DM has been increasing rapidly. Our objective was to compare the prevalence of pre-DM and DM in Nigerian individuals with a history of COVID-19 to individuals without known COVID-19 infection.\n","METHODS: We undertook a retrospective cohort study with 256 individuals with a past medical history of COVID-19 with no history of pre-DM or DM and 256 individuals without a history of COVID-19 or pre-DM/DM. Participants were categorized as pre-DM (fasting capillary glucose 100-125 mg/dL) or DM (fasting capillary glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL). We employed univariate and multivariable logistic regression to identify key predictors and adjust for confounders related to hyperglycaemia risk factors. Additionally, we used multinomial logistic regression to analyze the relationship between COVID-19 history and diabetes status, distinguishing between normal, pre-diabetic, and diabetic glucose levels. All models were adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, physical activity, central adiposity, and family history of DM.\n","RESULTS: Compared to the control group, those with a history of COVID-19 had a similar median age (38 vs. 40 years, p = 0.84), had a higher proportion of men (63% vs. 49%), and had a lower prevalence of central adiposity (waist: hip ratio ≥ 0.90 for males and WHR ≥ 0.85 for females) (48% vs. 56.3%, p = 0.06). Of the 256 with a history of COVID-19, 44 (17%) required in-patient care. The median (interquartile range) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and the glycaemic assessment was 19 (IQR: 14, 24) months. Pre-DM prevalence was 27% in the post-COVID-19 group and 4% in\n","\u001b[00m\n","\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mthe control group (p < 0.001). DM prevalence was 10% in the post-COVID-19 group and 2% in the control group (p < 0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression model, a history of COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of pre-DM (odds ratio [OR] = 8.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2-15.6, p < 0.001) and DM (OR = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.1-14.0, p < 0.001). In the multinomial logistic regression model, a history of COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of pre-DM (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 7.3, 95% CI = 3.7-14.4, p < 0.001) and DM (RRR = 5.3, 95% CI = 2.2-12.9, p < 0.001) compared to normal glucose levels.\n","CONCLUSION: In this cohort of Nigerian individuals, a history of COVID-19 was associated with an increased risk of pre-DM and DM, independent of traditional risk factors. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 may contribute to the increasing burden of DM in Africa. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms and optimal screening strategies for post-COVID-19 hyperglycaemia.\n","\n","Thought:\n","I need to find out more specific symptoms of diabetes.\n","\n","Action:\n","pub_med\n","\n","Action Input:\n","{\"query\": \"specific symptoms of diabetes\"}\n","\n","Observation\u001b[0mToo Many Requests, waiting for 0.40 seconds...\n","\u001b[95m \n","\n","Published: 2024-09-12\n","Title: A national survey of current rehabilitation service provisions for people living with chronic kidney disease in the UK: implications for policy and practice.\n","Copyright Information: © 2024.
